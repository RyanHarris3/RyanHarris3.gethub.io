            E. Coli or Escherichia coli was first discovered in Germany in 1885 by Professor Theodor Escherichia.  This bacteria can be found in the digestive system, mainly in your intestines.  It helps collect vitamin k and other vitamins in the colon. This goes for everything that eats and poops. The recent outbreaks that have to do with E. coli were mainly in romaine lettuce.  The reason was that many farmers use manure as a fertilizer for their crops. Although that might sound good, because of the nutrients you can get from it and of how cheap it is, but E. coli will find its way onto the crops. It has also found its way into meat (mainly ground beef) and water.</p1>
