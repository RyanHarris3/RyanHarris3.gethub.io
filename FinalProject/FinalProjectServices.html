	    <p>What we are informing you about today is the disease known as E.Coli. E.Coli is a bacterial disease that has been around in multi-million industries for example industries like Chipotle and Jack in the box. In our research romaine lettuce is more likely to get E.Coli. You’re probably wondering why do I care about E.Coli	it doesn’t sound that bad. Well it is that bad but not a worry because we have a solution to this problem. We have found a potential solution for this problem for E.Coli. 
	
One way people have obtained E.Coli is because of the manure that comes from cows. Cow manure not only gives you E.Coli but as well it contains loads of methane which is also really difficult for our environment as well as destroying the ozone layer in the process. Our goal is to both stop E.Coli as well as find a alternative to cow manure.We have decided that compost would be the best alternative to manure because it eco-friendly and it works just as well as manure too. If more people use our methods and ditch cow manure the E.Coli rates would drastically drop and we would have healthier, cleaner corn.
